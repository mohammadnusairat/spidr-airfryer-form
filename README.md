# Spidr Coding Challenge - Full-Stack Software Engineer (Entry-Level)

Congrats, Mohammad! You have been selected to move forward in our hiring process for the Full-Stack Software Engineer (Entry-Level) position at Spidr Design. This email outlines a coding challenge that will assess your ability to craft user interfaces and write clean code.


Pretend Spidr Design is unveiling a new, exciting air fryer. We’re adding a landing page to our single-page website so our magnificent cooking appliance can help sell itself. The marketing team has already put together a landing page showcasing its awesome capabilities, but we need to develop a custom application to embed as an interest form at the bottom of the page. 


The concept here is entirely fictitious- these form fields are ridiculous and would never be used by Spidr. We’re just looking to see how well you can pick up on a brand’s style and incorporate its visual identity into an interface.


Create a simple React app that contains a single-page form that contains the following fields:

First name

Last name

Phone number

Email address

Guess the air fryer’s cost (dollar amount)

A very, very secret 16-digit Spidr PIN. Digits are formatted with dashes in groups of four “####-####-####-####”. 

There should be a submit button at the bottom of the form. This doesn’t need to do anything meaningful- just print the user’s form data to the console. 


Since this project would be used as an embed at the bottom of the landing page, your react app does not need to have all page elements (header, navbar, footer, etc). Just focus on making a user-friendly form, and make the style inspired as closely to https://spidr.design/ as possible.


In order to produce an easily reviewable submission:

Publish your project’s source code in a public Github/Gitlab repository.

Build your React bundle and use free cloud resources to publish your app. You can use anything to do this- some example resources are Github pages, Free-tier AWS, GCS public bucket. There should be a public link where we can access your UI. 


Qualified applicants should be able to complete this task in roughly three hours. Usage of AI tools is encouraged. If you can’t complete the challenge in three hours or less, you’re not ready for work at Spidr just yet. This isn’t a ‘fake it till you make it’ position. If this isn’t currently in your wheelhouse, be honest with us (and yourself) and keep polishing your skills! Check back for future postings when you’re ready - and we’ll enjoy hearing the story about how you’ve grown.


To submit your challenge, please respond to this email with:

The link to your public repository

The link to your publicly available app 


Submissions must be submitted by end of day Wednesday, July 16, 2025.


Good luck, and happy coding!
